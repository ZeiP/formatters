# Formatters for a few annoying file formats.

## fin-ktl.py

The Finnish KTL format can be used to generate ASCII based banking reference payment files. This might be useful for example with the Kehätieto Kilta registry system, which accepts this kind of data for sales ledger payment data import.

## LAIdat.py

LAI.dat is a file format used for example in the Avisor e-accounting system to import invoices generated outside the system (the ”Econet” data.)
